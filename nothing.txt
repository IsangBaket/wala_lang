E
hi I know were not talking for a while now.
And, I just want to say thank you for those moments. I truly cherish all our memories together. 
I'm still regretting my actions last February.
It's a memory that will haunt me forever.
But I'm also thankful for it.
Because, that memory served as a foundation for the strength and courage I possessed today.
I still include you in my prayers Peachy.
I will always pray for your happiness.

Kamusta ka na kaya ngayon?
It has  been a long time so nagbago ka na siguro?
Mayroon na bang taong nageffort gumawa ng surprise for you?
Nagkatuluyan kaya kayo ni Clyde?
Nahihirapan ka pa rin kaya magswallow ng tablet medicine?
Have you tried on new outfit styles?
Naging masaya ka kaya sa Grandball niyo?
I wish we could see eachother improve
Test program lang dapat to
pero nagsusulat nako sa terminal HAHAHAHA
I should end this here na
I wish you the best Peachy! <3
